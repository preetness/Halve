## String Manipulation

We are tasked with the assignment of creating a method that takes in a string, and performs the following manipulation on it:

* Change all of the vowels to the next vowel in 'aeiou'
* Swaps the first and last name
* Changes all of the consonants to the next consonant in the alphabet.

Phew. This is going to be tough!
